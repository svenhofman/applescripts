# AppleScripts for Workflow

This repository contains a collection of AppleScripts Iâ€™ve written to streamline various tasks in my daily workflow. Hopefully they'll be of use to you :)

I bind these scripts to keyboard shortcuts using [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai)

Scripts included:

- `HideMyEmail`: Opens System Settings and navigates to the Hide My Email panel (Apple ID > iCloud > Hide My Email)

- `RemoveEncapsulatingFolder`: If a folder is selected in Finder, it will extract the items of that folder into the current directory, and remove the folder itself

- `ShowFinderWindow`: Brings the current Finder window of the current desktop forward. If no window exists for the current desktop, it creates a new one
